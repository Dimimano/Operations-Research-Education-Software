This project is still in progress and currently only features a presentation for the Simplex algorithm (Tableau method).

In the main part, the user solves the Reddy Mikks problem using the algorithm through a 20-questions Quiz, examining each of the algorithm steps. It is made using Tkinter, python's standard GUI library.

In order to improve the user's intuition on the algorithm, on the last part, is a 5-minute video showcasing the algorithm's geometrical interpretation. It is made using Manim, 3b1b animation engine.
