This project is still in progress and currently only features a presentation for the Simplex algorithm (Tableau method).

In the main part, the user solves the Reddy Mikks problem using the algorithm through a 20-questions Quiz, examining each of the algorithm steps. It is made using Tkinter, python's standard GUI library (Tableau.py).

In order to improve the user's intuition on the algorithm, on the last part, is a 5-minute video showcasing the algorithm's geometrical interpretation. It is made using Manim, 3b1b's animation engine and Adobe After Effects (Manim.py).

In the final part of this project, a solver for multivariable non-linear constrained optimization is created, which aims to solve simple problems (2 variables + a few constraints) with the user's 'help' through an interactive quiz generated for each problem given by the user.
